There is a OPAM package that the user needs to install to play this game.

To install it open your terminal and run:

opam install graphics


It will ask you a series of prompts, you want to say yes to all of the prompts
(you can simply type 'y' as a response)

It might take a moment, but eventually It will finish and you will need to run:

eval $(opam env)

to reconfigure your new opam package to its enviroment. Another alternative is 
restarting your device but you do not have to do this.

Once you have finished this check if it works by running the following lines in utop:

#require "graphics";;

open Graphics;;

open_graph " 480x270";;

The result should result in a dialogue box popping up with the specified 
dimensions in open_graph.
